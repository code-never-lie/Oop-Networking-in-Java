Network Programming

What is Network?

A certain number of Autonomous, dispersed but interconnected computer via  
Communication path in order to share information.

- Autonomous (Controlling itself)

- Dispersed ( Geographically Dispersed in a room, Building or all over the 
 		 world)

- Communication Path (cable oriented/ cable less)

OSI Model
- Physical Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Network Layer
- Transport Layer
- Session Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Application Layer

Physical Layer
- Relationship between devices and physical Medium
- Mutiplexing Vs Demultiplexing
- Modulation and Demodulation
Devices
 - Repeater
 - Mutiplexer/Demultiplexer

Data Link Layer
- Error and Flow Control
- MAC(Media Access Control) vs LLC (Logical Link Control)IEEE802.2
- MAC Address (6 bytes)
- Access Methods (CSMACD,CSMACA)
- Topologies logical(Bus, Ring), Physical(star,bus,mesh etc)
- Ethernet (100BT,100BFx,100B2) IEEE802.3 wired IEEE802.11 Wireless
- Channel Properties(Atteneuation, bandwidth, noise )
Devices
- Bridges
- Lan Card

Network Layer
-include routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and error, and network-layer address assignment.
- Logical Addressing Scheme (Ip4 vs Ipv6) 
- Assembling and Deassebling Packets
- Packet Switches
- Network Routes
- Routing Table
devices
 - Router
 -Brouter

Transport Layer
- transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data     transfer services to the upper layers.
-The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow   control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error contro
- Domain Names
- Connection Oriented vs Connection Less Protocols
- TCP vs UDP
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-based protocol that provides a reliable flow of data between two computers.

-UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a protocol that sends independent packets of data, called datagrams, from one computer to another with no guarantees about arrival. UDP is not connection-based like TCP.

Devices
 - Router
 - Brouter

Session Layer
-  It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local   and remote application
- 3 way handShaking
- It provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation
- Ports
- The TCP and UDP protocols use ports to map incoming data to a particular   process running on a computer.
- Connection Establishment and Release

Presentation Layer
- Presents data according to network and format
- Marshaling and Unmarshalling
- Data Independence

Application Layer
- This layer interacts with software applications that implement a    communicating component.
- network application Sofwares
Examples
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP),
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
